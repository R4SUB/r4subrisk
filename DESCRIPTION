Description: Quantifies submission risk using a Failure Modes and Effects
    Analysis (FMEA)-inspired framework (probability, impact, detectability).
    Builds risk registers from evidence, computes Risk Priority Numbers (RPN),
    classifies risk levels, and emits standardized R4SUB (R for Regulatory
    Submission) evidence table rows via 'r4subcore'. Supports risk mitigation
    tracking and trend analysis across submission milestones.
